####Welcome to Faurecia's BioFit SDK infomation page!

#####And thank you for your interest in developing with us!  

Faurecia has developed what might be the ultimate wearable device – the world’s first fully connected automotive seat. We call it BioFit™, and in addition to connectivity, a complete array of advanced biosensors are included. We’re launching this seat with one of our global automaker partners soon, and we’re interested in new creative use cases – either within the seat, vehicle cabin, or beyond, that can take advantage of our technology. To make this possible, we’re releasing the BioFit™ SDK – which provides access to seat data streams, such as real time occupant heart rate, blood pressure, breathing rate, and stress levels. In addition, our API allows apps to directly control certain features of the seat system, such as climate control, posture adjustment, and massage functions – delivering enhanced comfort precisely when needed.

For everything you need to begin developing with BioFit, please see the links below.
